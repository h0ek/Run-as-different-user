# Run-as-different-user
Simple PowerShell script to run Active Directory snap in and other executable files using different account.

To use this script you need to have installed Remote Server Administration Tools on your Windows.

I created this script to make it easier to run the Active Directory snap-in and other applications using various domain accounts in Windows 10.
